# AEM Unsplash Integration 

This project demonstrates the AEM integration with Unsplash (It is a website dedicated to sharing stock photography).

## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

If you have a running AEM instance you can build and package the whole project and deploy into AEM with

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackagePublish

Or alternatively

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

## ClientLibs

The frontend module is made available using an [AEM ClientLib](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/clientlibs.html). When executing the NPM build script, the app is built and the [`aem-clientlib-generator`](https://github.com/wcm-io-frontend/aem-clientlib-generator) package takes the resulting build output and transforms it into such a ClientLib.

A ClientLib will consist of the following files and directories:

- `css/`: CSS files which can be requested in the HTML
- `css.txt` (tells AEM the order and names of files in `css/` so they can be merged)
- `js/`: JavaScript files which can be requested in the HTML
- `js.txt` (tells AEM the order and names of files in `js/` so they can be merged
- `resources/`: Source maps, non-entrypoint code chunks (resulting from code splitting), static assets (e.g. icons), etc.
